### A "dungeon crawler" game that involves our hero treking through a randomly generated dungeon, defeating nameless monsters along the way. The backstory for this game is as follows: an evil kid destroyed all dictionaries in the world out of spite, because he lost a spelling bee. The goal of the game is to collect the missing words by defeating the nameless monsters, through answering a question relating to the word.
